    Peter Crouch scored 51 headers.<br>
    Paul Robinson, who had a successful career in England’s top flight with spells at Leeds, Spurs and Blackburn Rovers was by far the Premier league’s most attacking goalkeeper.
    The 41-cap England International has not only scored a Premier League goal but also has most assists by a keeper (5). He has also won a penalty in the opponent’s penalty box.
    Robinson’s only goal came when he took a free-kick from 95 yards against Watford, as it sailed over a helpless Ben Foster’s head back in the 2007/08 Premier League season. A real 11th outfield player!<br>
    The Premier league’s most cursed player in terms of relegations, Sebastien Bassong would want to wish for better fortune. The Cameroonian defender has been relegated a record 4 times with three different Premier League teams, more than any other player.<br>
    Sadio Mané scored a hat-trick (3 goals) in 2 mins 56 seconds for Southampton against Aston Villa in 2015<br>
